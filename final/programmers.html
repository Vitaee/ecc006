                  <h3>Ruby Monroe</h3>
                  <p>The refugee crisis in 2015 hit me pretty strongly. I’m from Venezuela myself, and over the past years, many of my countrymen have had to flee as well due to the political climate. So when I experienced it in Europe too, I immediately started thinking about solutions.

                  I think what really drove me to start Code Your Future was the fact that big tech companies made a lot of promises and pledged to have a positive impact on the crisis, yet nothing happened. That’s when I knew I had to step in and present something tangible, and it was natural to me to use tech as an enabler..</p>

              <p>Basically, I didn't know all the things that you have to check to make sure a startup idea is a good idea. People talk about, oh the idea doesn't matter, it's the execution. That is totally false, because ... Oh, ideas are a dime a dozen. And product ideas are a dime a dozen, but ideas with the potential to germinate into a business with a sales plan, with a marketing plan, with a growth plan which are defensible, things that can be done now, things where you can create a crappy prototype and still sell it and not have to have the thing perfect in order to work, those ideas are very rare. </p>
